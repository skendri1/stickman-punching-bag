What Currently Works
	As of Milestone Beta, the following is currently working.
			All from Milestone Alpha

					There are now two buttons that the user can use to punch.
			Pause Button
				Right now the pause button just pauses the game

What Needs to Be Completed
	The following still needs to be completed.
		Animations for the stickman testing  
		Implement Pause of the Time Trial Game.
		Error Catching (Should be done, but needs more testing)
		Pause and restart game when leaving.

Modifications of Project from Proposal
	Most of the Proposals and Ideas from the Project Proposal are still on schedule to be completed on time. 
	There are not any modifications to the proposal that were not mentioned on the last milestone report.

Progress Related to Proposed Schedule
	The progress as it relates to the proposed schedule is on track, with a few modifications. Those modifications 
	are just the timing of things like the pause button to be complete by now. The project is still on track to be completed on schedule.

Major Problems Encountered
	There was only one big problem that was encountered during work for Milestone Beta. The animations image files caused 
	a OutOfMemory Exception during runtime. I fixed this by decreasing the number of images I use and making the project use 
	a large heap. Besides that, there were only minor problems that were fixed easily.
